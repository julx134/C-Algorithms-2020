Everything in the lab worked as intended.

However, note that for the swap metric because there was difference in implementing of the algorithm,
I only used myCopy() and not mySwap(). Regardless, the number of swaps and copies correspond to the 
analysis of the complexity of the algorithm and having the analysis be entirely driven by the
myCopy() metric, is the same as analyzing the algorithm with myCopy() and mySwap() metric.

In addition, the comparison metric is not part of the analysis, but I derived an equation for the sake of it.
This is because in analyzing algorithms, comparing values does not require any steps or 'n', and so
it is left out.

Also note that the array is contained within the files array_Best.txt,array_Worst.txt and array_Average.txt. 
As the name suggests, those files contain the arrays sorted in a way that correspond to the performance of the algorithm.

The algorithm analysis and equations are shown below:

InsertionSort:

Worst Case:
Comparisons+Swaps = n^2 -1

Best Case:
Comparisons+Swaps = n-1

Merge-Sort:
